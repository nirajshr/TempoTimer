# TempoTimer
A tempo trainer app for garmin watch. Works as a metronome. Keeps a customizable tempo by using vibration as a feedback.

Example of usage:
* Swimming: Wear this while you are swimming, and the vibration tempo can by synced to your stroke rate.
* Cycling: Helps maintain a known cadence.
* Runing: Maintain a consistence pace.

Feedback/Support
I have only tested this with Garmin Vivoactive HR. It should work with other device. Feel free to open a PR to fix any bugs and add features.
